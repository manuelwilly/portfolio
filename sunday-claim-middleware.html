          <p>Claim Middleware is a claims management platform that streamlines the entire claim lifecycle for the Sunday claims team. This project aimed to resolve the inefficiencies of the existing manual insurance claim process. That process involved using multiple spreadsheets and documents to assess incoming claims, track their processing status, and delegate claim assignments. These inefficiencies resulted in longer claim processing times and lower claim processing rates for the team.</p>

          <h3>Problem statement</h3>
          <p>Sunday's existing claims management system relies on inefficient manual processes, such as spreadsheets and documents. This has led to slow claim processing times, negatively impacting operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.</p>

          <h3 class="heading-border">Platform users</h3>
          <p>We identified 3 distinct user roles: Claim Admins, Claim Assessors, and Claim Manager. Each role has its own duties and different levels of access to features on the platform.</p>
          <img alt="Claim middleware users" src="img/sunday/cm-users.jpg">

          <h3 class="heading-border">Key pain points</h3>
          <p>At the beginning of the project, we held discussions with the claims team and the Development Director to plan how to improve the existing claims process for greater efficiency. Through focus group discussions with the team, we identified key pain points in the current process.</p>

          <h4>Key pain points of the existing manual claim process:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Lack of transparency and visibility makes it difficult to monitor claim statuses and identify potential bottlenecks</li>
            <li>Low claim processing rates stem from inefficiencies that hinder the team's ability to process claims quickly and accurately</li>
            <li>Long claim processing times result from manual data entry and document transfers</li>
            <li>Increased risks of errors from manual processes lead to inaccuracies and delays in claim settlements</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="heading-border">Understanding competitive landscape</h3>
          <p>We conducted a competitive analysis of leading claims management platforms to identify their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for innovation. This benchmarking informed our design decisions and helped us identify established design patterns, interaction models, and features that are recognized as industry best practices.</p>
          <img alt="Claim middleware competitive analysis" src="img/sunday/cm-competitive-analysis.jpg">

          <h3 class="heading-border">Defining the goal</h3>
          <p>Our goal was to develop an MVP version of a claims management platform for Sunday Insurance, namely Claim Middleware. This platform will streamline the entire claims lifecycle by enabling the Sunday claims team to seamlessly assess incoming claims, track claim processing status, and delegate claim assignments.</p>

          <p>My task was to design the end-to-end claim processing workflows from pre-assessment, assessment, to assessment results from scratch. I also facilitated the team's understanding of these complex workflows by creating detailed, annotated flowcharts to map out the user journey.</p>

          <h3 class="heading-border">Ideating through wireframes</h3>
          <p>After successfully mapping out the overall user journey, I pivoted to the wireframing phase for key pages such as the claim list and claim details. Utilizing existing design systems and UI components, my objective was to create a scalable and cohesive design architecture. By doing so, I aimed to ensure brand consistency and facilitate easier design updates in the future.</p>

          <h4>Proposed features:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Claim list with sort and filter capabilities for each column header</li>
            <li>Comprehensive claim details information for non-optical and optical claims</li>
            <li>Claim Admins can conduct a pre-assessment process immediately after claims are submitted by clients</li>
            <li>Claim Assessors can conduct an assessment process after claims are reviewed by Claim Admins</li>
            <li>Claim Manager can assign Claim Admins and Claim Assessors to handle specific clients</li>
            <li>Claim Manager can disable access and set active date for Claim Admins and Claim Assessors for leave situations</li>
            <li>Creating new claim manually to accommodate claims submitted via email or WhatsApp messages</li>
